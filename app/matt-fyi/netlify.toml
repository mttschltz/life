# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds – they do not get scoped to

# PER-DEPLOY.

# A basic redirect rule
# [[redirects]]

# The default HTTP status code is 301, but you can define a different one.
# status = 302

# By default, redirects won’t be applied if there’s a file with the same
# path as the one defined in the `from` property. Setting `force` to `true`
# will make the redirect rule take precedence over any existing files.
# force = true

# Redirect from /old-path?id=123 to /new-path. Each combination of query
# params needs to be defined in a separate [[redirects]] block.
# More information at https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#query-parameters

# Redirect based on browser language and geolocation.
